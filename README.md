Meanwhile, I cooked up a short story to entertain you.

# Hey, why did you photograph my butt? As punishment I demand you bend my body right angles to the left. I've been stuck in this straight position for far too long.
![](2.JPEG)
# Gently, squeeze the flat sides (not the corners) and pull to remove my head.
![](3.JPEG)
# Don't worry I won't die.
![](4.JPEG)
# Now lay out my insides as shown. From the left right, the first two columns are Panel 1s, the third column is Panel 2 and, the fourth column is panel 3, and the last column is a mix of panels 3 and 4.
![](5.JPEG)
# to reduce confusion, shift the panel 3 from the last column to the left.
![](6.JPEG)
# split my body by one segment
![](7.JPEG)
# and split it in half again. Position my head roughly at right angles to my main body.
![](8.JPEG)
# now we make up the missing parts. Take three pieces of Panel 1 (left most column) and arrange as shown. (bottom left corner)
![](9.JPEG)
# connect the first two pieces right angles to each other.
![](10.JPEG)
# and connect the third right angles to the previous two.
![](11.JPEG)
# now repeat and make another corner.
![](12.JPEG)
# join the corners together
![](13.JPEG)
# rearrange my parts a little and - looks halfway there already. only need to fill in the gaps.
![](14.JPEG)
# lay out panels 1,2 and 3 as in the bottom left corner
![](15.JPEG)
# join the panels together.
![](16.JPEG)
# and together
![](17.JPEG)
# and it seems fit just nice, just one more piece.
![](18.JPEG)
# what do you mean there's no enough pieces?!? all right you can detach another segment to take off a panel 2. We will solve the problem later.
![](19.JPEG)
# sigh there is now a feeling of incompleteness.
![](20.JPEG)
# but at least the corner bend piece is done.
![](21.JPEG)
# now to put everything together again.
![](22.JPEG)
# ah that feels good.
![](23.JPEG)
# the snap and crunch - just heaven
![](24.JPEG)
# all the fatigue seems to have gone...
![](25.JPEG)
# mmm...
![](26.JPEG)
# and the at I am whole again.
![](27.JPEG)
# And yes, please go look for that choonway and ask him to give you another piece of panel 2 so that you can join that segment back again. he must have somehow forgotten to put it in.
